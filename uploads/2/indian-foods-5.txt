A 1400-calorie fat loss plan must prioritize protein and fiber to ensure satiety. An effective structure involves a protein-rich breakfast like Moong Dal Chilla, a balanced lunch with dal, sabzi, and millets, and a light dinner like vegetable soup to maintain a deficit without hunger. This approach teaches the agent to build plans around satiety, not just calorie counting.

For a 2500-calorie muscle gain plan, meal frequency and protein density are paramount. This includes mid-morning snacks like peanuts and a pre-sleep meal like turmeric milk.

A simple yet impactful dietary swap is replacing four deep-fried puris (around 400-450 calories) with two plain rotis (160-200 calories).

A home-style Bengali Rohu fish curry (Macher Jhol) is a healthy protein choice, with a serving having around 250-300 calories. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and high-quality protein. The agent should learn to recommend preparations with minimal oil and avoid rich, creamy gravies.

Sarson ka Saag is a nutrient-dense Punjabi dish, but traditional preparations with lots of butter can reach 300-400 calories per bowl. When paired with one Makki di Roti (150-180 kcal), it forms a complete meal. Advising clients to use less butter is crucial to keep this dish healthy.

An ideal Indian pre-workout snack should provide quick energy from simple carbs. A small banana (90 kcal) or two dates (khajoor) (50 kcal), consumed 30-45 minutes before exercise, are perfect. They offer an instant energy boost without being heavy on the stomach.

A fantastic Indian post-workout recovery drink is a sattu shake. Mixing 30g of sattu powder in water provides about 12g of protein and complex carbs for just over 100 calories. This aids in immediate muscle repair and replenishes energy stores efficiently and affordably.

To create a diet plan that reduces bloating, the agent should recommend limiting raw gas-forming vegetables like cabbage. A simple, effective remedy is to suggest drinking ajwain (carom seeds) water after meals. This traditional practice aids digestion and provides relief from indigestion and gas.

To handle cravings for chaat, the agent should suggest healthier alternatives. A plate of Bhel Puri (around 200 kcal) is a better choice than Sev Puri (350-400 kcal) due to the high amount of fried sev. Preparing chaat at home with baked papdis can further reduce calories.

Buttermilk (chaas) is a superior beverage choice, with a glass containing only 40-60 calories. It's a natural probiotic that aids digestion and cools the body. The agent should recommend adding roasted cumin (jeera) and mint to enhance its digestive properties.

Litti Chokha can be a balanced meal, but its preparation is key. The baked litti (dough ball) is healthy, but it is traditionally dipped in ghee, which adds significant calories. The agent should advise enjoying the litti with the nutritious Baingan Chokha (eggplant mash) and using ghee sparingly.

The steamed South Indian snack Idiyappam is a very light and healthy option, with one serving having only 80-120 calories. It is a much better choice than a flaky Malabar Parotta, which is made with refined flour and fat, and can contain 250-300 calories. This is a crucial swap for clients in South India.

Hydration during hot Indian summers requires replenishing electrolytes, not just water. The agent should recommend homemade nimbu pani (lemonade) with a pinch of salt and black pepper instead of sugar. Bel (wood apple) sherbet is another excellent traditional cooler.

Raw jackfruit (kathal) is an excellent meat substitute for vegetarians. It is low in calories (about 95 kcal per 100g) and high in fiber, making it great for weight management sabzis. The agent should clarify that ripe jackfruit, however, is a high-sugar fruit.
