Dietician Agent Knowledge Base
========================================

1. Understanding Calories:
Calories are the unit of energy that fuels your body. Consuming fewer calories than you burn results in weight loss, while consuming more leads to weight gain.
It’s important to balance calories with activity levels and metabolic rate for sustainable results.

2. Role of Carbohydrates:
Carbs are the body’s primary energy source. Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good carbs that provide fiber and nutrients.
Avoid refined carbs like white bread and sugary snacks which spike insulin and cause fat storage.

3. Importance of Proteins:
Proteins are the building blocks of muscles, tissues, and enzymes. They are essential for repair and recovery.
Lean meats, legumes, dairy, and nuts are excellent protein sources that also aid in satiety.

4. Healthy Fats:
Fats are not the enemy—healthy fats like omega-3 and omega-6 support brain function and hormone regulation.
Sources include olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish such as salmon and tuna.

5. Fiber Intake:
Fiber helps digestion, regulates blood sugar, and promotes satiety.
Include whole grains, lentils, vegetables, and fruits in your diet to achieve 25–35g fiber daily.

6. Hydration:
Water is critical for metabolism, digestion, and detoxification.
Aim for 2–3 liters daily; more if you’re physically active or live in a hot climate.

7. Weight Loss Basics:
For fat loss, create a calorie deficit of 500–700 calories per day.
Focus on nutrient-dense foods, portion control, and consistent activity rather than crash diets.

8. Weight Gain Strategy:
To gain weight, aim for a calorie surplus with balanced macronutrients.
Combine strength training with calorie-dense foods like nuts, dairy, and whole grains.

9. Balanced Meals:
A healthy plate should include carbs, proteins, fats, and fiber.
Think of it as half vegetables, a quarter protein, and a quarter healthy carbs.

10. Role of Breakfast:
A nutritious breakfast kickstarts metabolism and improves focus.
Include protein (eggs, yogurt), healthy fats (nuts, avocado), and complex carbs (oats, whole wheat bread).

11. Snacking Wisely:
Healthy snacks prevent overeating at meals and stabilize blood sugar.
Opt for fruits, nuts, boiled eggs, or hummus with veggies instead of chips or sweets.

12. Importance of Micronutrients:
Vitamins and minerals are crucial for immunity, bone health, and energy production.
Include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to cover micronutrient needs.

13. Portion Control:
Even healthy food in excess can cause weight gain.
Use smaller plates, mindful eating, and measure servings to manage calorie intake.

14. Role of Exercise with Diet:
Exercise complements diet by burning calories and improving metabolism.
A combination of strength training and cardio enhances results.

15. Sleep and Diet:
Poor sleep disrupts hunger hormones (ghrelin and leptin) leading to overeating.
Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep daily for proper weight and appetite regulation.

16. Sugar Consumption:
Excess sugar contributes to obesity, diabetes, and heart issues.
Replace sugary drinks with water, infused water, or herbal teas.

17. Meal Timing:
Regular meals stabilize metabolism and energy.
Skipping meals can lead to overeating later and nutrient imbalance.

18. Protein for Weight Loss:
High-protein diets increase satiety and preserve muscle during fat loss.
Target 1.2–2g protein per kg body weight daily.

19. Protein for Weight Gain:
When gaining, protein helps build lean muscle instead of fat.
Combine protein intake with progressive resistance training.

20. Healthy Cooking Methods:
Steaming, grilling, baking, and sautéing preserve nutrients and cut unhealthy fats.
Avoid deep frying or heavy creams in regular cooking.

21. Dairy in Diet:
Low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese provide calcium and protein.
Avoid sweetened or processed dairy products that add excess sugar.

22. Vegetarian and Vegan Diets:
Plant-based diets can provide all nutrients if planned well.
Combine legumes with grains for complete protein and supplement B12 if needed.

23. Cheat Meals:
Occasional indulgence is fine, but balance it with healthy eating overall.
Don’t let one cheat meal turn into a cheat week.

24. Alcohol and Diet:
Alcohol is calorie-dense and provides little nutrition.
Limit intake as it affects metabolism and can lead to fat gain.

25. Superfoods:
Foods like chia seeds, quinoa, berries, and green tea are nutrient-rich.
They enhance immunity, digestion, and overall wellness.

26. Meal Prepping:
Planning meals in advance prevents unhealthy food choices.
Prepping helps with portion control, consistency, and cost savings.

27. Gut Health:
A healthy gut supports immunity and digestion.
Include probiotics (yogurt, kefir) and prebiotics (onions, garlic, bananas) regularly.

28. Mindful Eating:
Eating slowly and without distractions prevents overeating.
Focus on hunger cues and enjoy the flavors of food.

29. Supplements:
Supplements like protein powder, multivitamins, and omega-3s can help fill gaps.
They should complement diet, not replace whole foods.

30. Long-Term Approach:
Dieting should be sustainable, not extreme.
Focus on lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes for lasting health benefits.
