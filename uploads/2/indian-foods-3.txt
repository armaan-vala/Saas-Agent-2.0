A single medium-sized whole wheat roti (chapati) is a staple and contains approximately 80-100 calories. It is a good source of complex carbohydrates and fiber, providing sustained energy. This makes it a far healthier choice than breads made from refined flour (maida).

In contrast to roti, a plain naan bread from a restaurant has a significantly higher calorie count, ranging from 250 to 350 calories per piece. This is due to its larger size and the use of refined flour, yogurt, and often butter. It offers fewer nutrients and can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar.

A plain, pan-fried paratha, even without any stuffing, contains about 150-200 calories due to the use of ghee or oil during cooking. While providing more energy, it also increases the fat content of the meal. Opting for a dry-roasted (tawa) paratha can help reduce the overall calorie load.

The popular Aloo Paratha is a calorie-dense food, with one medium piece containing anywhere from 250 to 400 calories. The calories come from the potato stuffing, the whole wheat dough, and the generous amount of ghee or butter used for frying. Serving it with curd is a better option than with extra butter.

A standard serving of cooked white rice (approximately 1 cup or 200g) contains around 200-220 calories. It is a source of simple carbohydrates that provides quick energy. For better blood sugar control and added fiber, it's advisable to control the portion size and pair it with protein-rich dals or sabzis.

Dal Tadka, a staple lentil dish, is highly nutritious and moderately caloric. A standard bowl (around 250ml) typically contains 180-250 calories, depending on the amount of ghee or oil used for the tempering (tadka). It's an excellent source of plant-based protein and dietary fiber.

Palak Paneer, a popular vegetarian curry, has a calorie range of 250-350 per standard bowl serving. The calories come from the paneer (cottage cheese) and the cream or oil used in the gravy. While rich in protein and iron, it's important to be mindful of the fat content from the gravy.

Butter Chicken is a rich, calorie-dense North Indian dish. A single serving can easily contain 400-550 calories, primarily from the chicken, butter, and cream used in its signature makhani gravy. It is best reserved for occasional consumption due to its high saturated fat content.

The chickpea curry in Chole Bhature, known as chole, is quite nutritious on its own. A single serving of chole has about 250-300 calories, offering a good amount of protein and fiber. However, the overall healthiness of the dish is reduced by what it's served with.

The bhatura, the deep-fried bread served with chole, is extremely high in calories. One large bhatura can contain 250-400 calories, mostly from refined flour and the oil it absorbs during frying. This makes the combination of Chole Bhature a very high-calorie meal, often exceeding 700-800 calories.

Pav Bhaji consists of a mixed vegetable mash (bhaji) served with soft bread rolls (pav). The bhaji itself, per serving, can be around 200-300 calories, but this number increases significantly with the amount of butter added. The pav, which is often toasted with butter, adds another 100-150 calories per piece.

Vada Pav, a popular Mumbai street food, is a high-carbohydrate snack. A single Vada Pav contains approximately 250-350 calories. The calories come from the deep-fried potato patty (vada) and the white bread roll (pav), making it a calorie-dense option.

Pani Puri, also known as Golgappe, can be a lower-calorie snack if prepared consciously. One plate of 6-7 puris with the standard spiced water and filling has around 100-150 calories. However, variations with sweet chutneys or fried additions can increase this count.

Chicken Biryani, a flavorful one-pot meal, is calorically dense. A standard restaurant serving can range from 400 to 600 calories. The calories are derived from the rice, chicken, and the generous use of oil or ghee during its preparation.

Vegetable Pulao is a lighter alternative to Biryani. A single serving typically contains 250-350 calories. While still primarily a carbohydrate dish, the inclusion of various vegetables increases its fiber and micronutrient content, making it a more balanced option.

A large Masala Dosa is a complete meal, but its calorie count can be deceivingly high, ranging from 350 to 500 calories. The calories come from the fermented rice-lentil crepe, the potato filling (masala), and the oil or ghee used to cook it. The accompanying sambar and chutney add to the overall count.

Dhokla, a steamed snack from Gujarat, is a relatively healthy and low-calorie option. One piece of Khaman Dhokla contains about 60-80 calories. It's made from fermented gram flour, making it a good source of protein and easy to digest.

Jalebi is a deep-fried sweet soaked in sugar syrup, making it extremely high in calories. Just one or two pieces of jalebi can contain 150-250 calories, almost entirely from refined flour, sugar, and oil. It offers very little nutritional value and should be consumed sparingly.

Gulab Jamun is another calorie-laden Indian dessert. A single piece contains between 150 and 250 calories, derived from the milk solids (khoya), refined flour, and the sugar syrup it is soaked in. Its high sugar and fat content make it a treat for special occasions only.

A typical cup of Indian Masala Chai, made with whole milk and one to two teaspoons of sugar, contains 60-90 calories. While the spices offer health benefits, the calories from milk and sugar can add up quickly if consumed multiple times a day. Opting for less sugar or skim milk can reduce the calorie content.
