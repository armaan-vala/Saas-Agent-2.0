Budgeting Basics – Always track income and expenses; use the 50/30/20 rule (needs/wants/savings).

Emergency Fund – Save at least 3–6 months of living expenses for unexpected events.

Debt Management – Prioritize high-interest debt first (like credit cards) before low-interest loans.

Investing 101 – Diversify across stocks, bonds, and mutual funds instead of putting all money in one place.

Compound Interest – Start investing early to take advantage of exponential growth over time.

Risk vs. Return – Higher returns usually come with higher risks; choose based on your goals and tolerance.

Retirement Planning – Contribute regularly to retirement accounts; small consistent investments grow big.

Avoid Scams – Be cautious of “get rich quick” schemes; always verify before investing.
