1. A "for loop" is used when we want to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times.  
It automatically handles counting so you don’t have to do it manually.  

2. The loop runs step by step, starting from a defined value and moving toward an end value.  
Each time it repeats, we call it an "iteration."  

3. In Python, a for loop is written with the keyword "for" followed by a variable name.  
The variable takes new values from a sequence (like a list or range).  

4. Example:  
for i in range(5):  
 print(i)  
This will print numbers 0 to 4.  

5. The "range(5)" function generates numbers 0,1,2,3,4.  
The loop runs 5 times because there are 5 values.  

6. The variable (here "i") changes in each iteration.  
In the first loop i=0, then i=1, until i=4.  

7. You can control the start and end of range:  
for i in range(2, 6):  
 print(i)  
This prints 2, 3, 4, 5.  

8. You can also add a "step value" to skip numbers.  
for i in range(0, 10, 2):  
 print(i)  
This prints even numbers from 0 to 8.  

9. A for loop can also iterate through items of a list.  
Example: for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "mango"]: print(fruit)  

10. For loops make repetitive tasks simple and error-free.  
Instead of writing the same code many times, you just loop it.
